# Introduction to Thirdbuy SDK

The Thirdbuy SDK is the simple way to plug into web3 commerce. It's fast to set up and integrate with.

### Private Beta

The Thirdbuy SDK is currently in a private-beta stage, with early adopters coming off of the waitlist to use the SDK. [Sign up on the waitlist](https://about.thirdbuy.com/developers) for early access.

The SDK will be launching to the public in early 2023.
